Place them in chronological order on a timeline. For each correct answer, you earn 10 points. But be careful: a mistake costs you 5 points and the card is removed. You'll then have to draw a new one. Three game modes are available to vary the challenges: üïπÔ∏è Classic: play without pressure, at your own pace ‚ù§Ô∏è With lives: three mistakes, and it's over ‚è±Ô∏è Timed: each card must be placed in a few seconds! Accumulate points, unlock new levels, and climb the rankings of the best players."
